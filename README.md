# Purpose of post_graduate_project

In this folder I have several projects in various degrees of completion.  

## Kidney Disease Data Set
The KidneyDiseaseClassification (and it's corresponding KidneyDisease.csv data file) are a clasification project I did in August, 2020.  The data set is from Kaggle, has 400 entries and 13 features.  The target variable is "has kidney disease" or "does not have kidney disease".   

The amount of cleaning was minimal.  I created several visualizations to help view the data range of the features and identify 
outliers using whisker plots and histograms.  I also plotted each feature against the target variable.

Modeling was done using logistic regression (data was standardized).  A confusion matrix, correlation matrix and precision/accuracy/F1-score/recall calculated.

The result of modeling indicated that the top 5 features are: hemoglobin, Specific Gravity, Albumin, Sodium and Sugar.

## King County Data Set
The KingCountyRedo (and it's corresponding kc_house_data.csv file) is a second effort to redo certain aspects of my original project from August, 2019.  

## Python Interview Practice
In an effort to strengthen my Python skills, I scoured the internet for good "coding challenges" to work on.  The 3 files (python_interview_practice 1, 2 and 3) are my "playground" to try out code challenges and practice new techniques.
